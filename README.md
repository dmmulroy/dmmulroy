## Hi there, I'm Dillon ðŸ‘‹

### I'm a Software Engineer with expertise in

- TypeScript
- JavaScript
- React
- Node
- and the broader JS ecosystem

My current passion and interests revolve around OCaml, Melange, and the wider realm of functional programming. I dedicate a significant portion of my time to promoting and educating others about OCaml and functional programming. Additionally, I'm actively engaged in developing for this ecosystem, which you can watch live on my Twitch stream at [twitch.tv/dmmulroy](https://twitch.tv/dmmulroy).

### Some of my notable and favorite work includes

- [tsc.nvim](https://github.com/dmmulroy/tsc.nvim) - A Neovim plugin for seamless, asynchronous project-wide TypeScript type-checking using the TypeScript compiler
- [create-melange-app](https://github.com/dmmulroy/create-melange-app.nvim) - A tool designed to scaffold Melange (A compiler to compile OCaml/ReasonML to JavaScript) applications. Its primary aim is to facilitate a swift and efficient onboarding process for JavaScript and TypeScript developers to the OCaml/ReasonML ecosystem.
